            <p>{ "Students accepted to the program spend a three-day weekend on Columbia's Campus. They are hosted by members of the team who not only provide them with housing for the weekend but serve as mentors to questions the students might have concerning college life and the application process." }</p>

            <p>{ "The students undergo various workshops in financial aid and admissions which are made to provide essential information about how to apply to college and how one goes about seeking and receiving financial assistances. The program also provides a chance for students to learn about different arts through dance workshops and performing arts workshops that include vocal, theatre, spoken word and visual arts." }</p>
            <p>{ "This program is not only meant to be fun and educational but was established to give under-served students awareness of the opportunities available for pursuing a higher education." }</p>
