					<h2> History </h2>
                			<p>Sabor is Columbia University's First Latino Dance Troupe.Since its establishment in 2003, Sabor has
                			evolved into more than just a Latino dance troupe; venturing into different styles of dancing it lives up to its name which
                			is defined by flavor. Seasoned with the Latino rhythms of salsa, meregue and bachata, Sabor's spicy spectrum has extended
                			to hip-hop, jazz, modern, bhangra and much more.</p>
	
                			<p>Since the Fall of 2005 Sabor has annually put on a show in Roone Arlege Auditorium located on Columbia University's Campus,
                			which is meant to celebrate and embrace the variety of styles that the Latino culture has to offer, while still displaying cultural
                			diversity by including dances of other traditions. These shows have also included performances by other Columbia University
                			student groups such as Onyx, Raw Elements, CU Bhangra, Orishas and Dhoom.</p>

                			<p>Below are the titles for past shows:</p>
